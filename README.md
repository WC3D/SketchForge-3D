## Why SketchForge

SketchForge is a lightweight CAD-style workspace for people who want to sketch, cut, and export 3D models quickly.

It is built for the satisfying loop: drop a shape, resize it, rotate it, make another shape a hole, group the result, import an STL if primitives are not enough, and export the finished model.

No login. Private projects autosave locally in your browser, with optional shared project storage on your own Docker server. No heavyweight CAD install just to make a useful part.

## What It Does

- **2D Sketching & Parametric Profiles** - draw parametric lines, Bézier curves, three-point arcs (start, end, then bulge), circles, rectangles, polygons, and text with constraints, distance dimensions, region selections, and revolve/extrude/sweep operations.
- **Local-first projects** - designs live in browser storage with generated project thumbnails.
- **Editable SKF project packages** - back up and transfer projects with their editable objects, imported assets, and available undo/redo history; optionally save to a shared Docker library.
- **Real 3D workplane** - grid, camera controls, snap settings, transform handles, outlines, and inspector controls.
- **Associative construction planes** - create offset, angled, flipped, face-attached, and midplanes for sketches away from the base workplane.
- **Primitive shape library** - boxes, cylinders, spheres, cones, pyramids, wedges, text, roofs, half spheres, torus shapes, tubes, and more.
- **Solid and hole workflow** - turn shapes into cutters and group them into final geometry.
- **Boolean Intersection** - keep only the geometry where selected solid and hole shapes overlap.
- **Reversible edge tools** - chamfer and fillet selected CAD edges, with history controls for removing applied edge features.
- **Rotated solid edge treatment** - chamfer and fillet preserve analytic box topology after one-, two-, or three-axis rotations.
- **Mesh sculpting** - Add, Subtract, and Smooth brushes with adjustable radius and strength, local remeshing, and undoable strokes processed in a background worker.
- **Scene overview** - search shapes and features, inspect groups, control visibility, locking, and hole state, and toggle or remove supported features.
- **Placement and navigation tools** - align, mirror, center selections on the workplane, focus the camera on a selection, and move objects using the snap grid.
- **3MF, STL, STEP, and SVG import** - bring outside models and vector profiles into the same workspace as primitives.
- **3MF, STL, OBJ, STEP, and SVG workflows** - export selected objects or the whole scene, including print-ready 3MF packages and exact STEP/B-Rep geometry where available.
- **Mobile support (alpha)** - touch-first geometry, sketch, and sculpt controls with compact phone/tablet layouts and pen input support.
- **Fast browser stack** - Next.js, React, TypeScript, Three.js, and Manifold/CSG geometry tooling.

### Camera and placement shortcuts

- Press **O** to switch between perspective and orthographic projection while preserving view direction and framing.
- Press **Shift+F** to focus the camera on the selection.
- Use **Center on workplane** to center the selected objects on the build plate without changing their elevation.
- Press **R** to rotate selected objects by 45 degrees around the active workplane normal, or **Shift+R** for 22.5 degrees.
- Arrow-key movement follows the snap grid; **Ctrl/Cmd+arrow** changes elevation. Holding a movement key produces one undo step when released.
- Duplicating an object keeps it at the source object's exact position, ready to move or edit.

### Sculpting and scene management

Select one unlocked solid and open **Sculpt**. Choose **Add**, **Subtract**, or **Smooth**, adjust the brush radius and strength, then drag over the surface. Each completed drag is one undoable stroke. Sculpting converts the object to a mesh and retains its source for reversible sculpt changes.

The **Scene** sidebar provides a searchable object/group overview. Selected objects expose visibility, lock, and hole controls, plus supported feature controls for fillet/chamfer, sculpt changes, sketch output, and group/intersection results.

### Project files and autosave

Private projects autosave in IndexedDB for the browser and site address you use. Export a **`.skf`** package to back up an editable project or move it between browsers, computers, and mobile devices. Opening a package creates a new local project. Geometry exports such as STL and 3MF are separate from editable project backups.

Current saves use **SKF format 2**, with deduplicated mesh/B-Rep/image assets and compact binary CAD display edges shared across history states. This reduces repeated autosave work and project storage. The reader still accepts format 1 packages, legacy JSON projects, and earlier JSON display-edge assets; new binary-edge saves require an updated reader.

See the [SKF project format documentation](docs/SKF_PROJECT_FORMAT.md) for package structure, history options, and compatibility details.

### Construction planes

Open **Geometry > Workplane** to choose the active sketch plane or create a persistent construction plane:

- **Offset** creates an XY, XZ, or YZ plane with an optional normal offset, local-X angle, and flipped normal.
- **Angle** rotates a new associative plane from the base XZ plane or an existing construction plane.
- **Mid-plane** creates a plane halfway between two parallel source planes, with an optional normal offset.
- **Associative face plane** creates a plane from a model face that follows the source object's movement, rotation, and resizing.

New angle and midplanes remain linked to their source planes. Select any listed plane as the active sketch plane before starting an extrude, revolve, or sweep sketch.

## Mobile Support — Alpha

SketchForge now includes **alpha mobile support** in the browser, with touch-first controls for phones and tablets. No separate mobile app or account is required. Tool ribbons scroll horizontally, menus stay within the viewport, touch targets are larger, and compact layouts use collapsible scene and shape-property panels.

| Touch input | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Tap in Edit mode | Select an object; tap empty space to clear selection |
| Drag an already-selected object | Move it in one undoable action |
| Drag empty space or an unselected object | Orbit the 3D camera |
| Two-finger drag / pinch | Pan / zoom |
| View (Navigate) | Navigate with one finger without editing; pan in sketch view |
| Multi | Toggle objects in or out of the selection by tapping |
| Edit in Sculpt / Draw in Sketch | Brush the mesh / use the active sketch tool |
| ? button | Show touch gesture help |
| Top toolbar undo/redo | Access history without a keyboard |

Pen input uses the active tool, and touch contacts are ignored while a pen is down. A second finger switches touch interaction to navigation; finish resize/rotate handle adjustments before starting a camera gesture.

**Status:** this is an early alpha/MVP. Automated Chromium/WebKit menu checks and Chromium touch/pen checks are available, but physical-device validation is still needed, especially for iOS Safari, Android Chrome, styluses, on-screen numeric entry, and large meshes.

To try it, open your Docker server's LAN address on a device on the same network, or start a development server with `npm run dev -- --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port 3001` and visit `http://<computer-LAN-IP>:3001`. Use `.skf` export/import to transfer editable projects. STL or 3MF exports can be downloaded and opened in a slicer; the alpha does not include direct slicer API integration.

See [Mobile Alpha](docs/MOBILE_ALPHA.md) for setup, gesture details, and device-testing instructions.

### 2D Sketching & Revolve Workflow

![SketchForge 2D Sketching feature overview](docs/media/sketchforge-editor-v0.8.0.png)

## Getting Started

Use the [hosted editor](https://sketchforge3d.com), install a desktop release, or run your own instance. Docker is the recommended self-hosted option.

| Path | Best for | Difficulty |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hosted browser editor | Try SketchForge without installing anything | Easiest |
| Desktop release | Windows, macOS, and Linux desktop use | Easy |
| Docker / FabLab server | Teachers, classrooms, shared computers, local network hosting | Recommended |
| Local development | Developers who want to edit the code | Medium |

SketchForge is local-first. Private projects stay in each user's browser storage, and model exports download through the browser. Docker users can explicitly save `.skf` files to their own server's shared project library. SketchForge does not upload models to a SketchForge cloud service.

## Desktop Releases

Desktop packaging supports a Windows x64 installer, macOS Intel/Apple Silicon DMGs, and Linux AppImages. Download the matching asset from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Formsmith746/SketchForge-3D/releases).

- **Windows:** run the `SketchForge-Setup-…-x64.exe` installer.
- **Linux:** mark the `.AppImage` executable in your file manager's permissions, then launch it.
- **macOS:** follow the DMG instructions below.

### macOS

GitHub releases include macOS DMG files for Intel (`x64`) and Apple Silicon (`arm64`) Macs. Choose the file that matches your Mac.

1. Open the downloaded DMG file.
2. Drag `SketchForge.app` to the `Applications` folder.
3. Eject the DMG file.
4. Control-click `SketchForge.app` in `Applications`.
5. Select **Open**, then select **Open** again.

Unsigned releases have `-unsigned` in the file name. macOS shows a Gatekeeper warning for these releases. If macOS does not show the **Open** option, run this command in Terminal:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/SketchForge.app
open /Applications/SketchForge.app
```

Do not open the app from Safari's Downloads folder or directly from the mounted DMG. Copy it to `Applications` first.

### macOS Virtual Machines

Some macOS virtual machines do not provide hardware WebGL. Launch SketchForge with software WebGL in that case:

```bash
/Applications/SketchForge.app/Contents/MacOS/SketchForge \
  --use-angle=swiftshader \
  --enable-unsafe-swiftshader
```

## Download the Project

If you already know Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Formsmith746/SketchForge-3D.git
cd SketchForge-3D
```

If you do not know Git yet:

1. Open the GitHub page for this repository.
2. Press the green **Code** button.
3. Press **Download ZIP**.
4. Extract the ZIP somewhere easy to find, such as your Desktop.
5. Open a terminal in the extracted folder.

On Windows, you can open PowerShell in the folder by opening the folder, clicking the address bar, typing `powershell`, and pressing Enter.

## Docker / FabLab Server (Recommended)

Docker is the easiest way to run SketchForge for a classroom, workshop, or FabLab. It packages the build tools, Next.js server, health check, persistent shared-project storage, and restart behavior together.

### What You Need

- Docker Desktop on Windows or macOS, or Docker Engine on Linux
- Docker Compose, which is included with modern Docker Desktop
- This repository downloaded on the server computer

If `docker` is not recognized, install Docker Desktop and open it once before running the commands.

### Start SketchForge

#### Compose (Build images locally)

From the SketchForge project folder, run:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose.yaml up --build -d
```

The first start can take a few minutes because Docker builds the app.

#### Compose (Prebuilt)

From the SketchForge project folder or with the downloaded `deploy/docker/compose-ghcr.yaml`, run:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose-ghcr.yaml up -d
```

#### Standalone (Prebuilt)

```bash
docker run -d --name sketchforge --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e SKETCHFORGE_SHARED_PROJECTS_DIR=/data/projects \
  -v sketchforge-shared-projects:/data/projects \
  ghcr.io/formsmith746/sketchforge-3d:latest
```

After running, open this on the same computer:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

If that works, SketchForge is running.

The container listens on port `3000`. It also accepts connections on port `80` for backward compatibility with older UnRAID templates and forwards them to the same server. New Docker and UnRAID configurations should use container port `3000`.

### Shared Docker Projects

Docker deployments include a shared `.skf` project library. Private projects still autosave in each user's browser. The **Shared** dashboard section lists files stored in `/data/projects`, and **Export → SKF → Save to shared** writes the current project there. Revision-matched PNG previews are stored beside the library in `/data/projects/.thumbnails` and appear on shared project cards.

Compose uses the persistent `sketchforge-shared-projects` volume by default. To use a directory on the Docker host instead, set `SKETCHFORGE_SHARED_PROJECTS_VOLUME` before starting Compose:

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:SKETCHFORGE_SHARED_PROJECTS_VOLUME = "C:/SketchForge/shared-projects"
docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose.yaml up --build -d
```

Linux or macOS:

```bash
SKETCHFORGE_SHARED_PROJECTS_VOLUME=/srv/sketchforge-projects docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose.yaml up --build -d
```

Opening a shared file creates a private local working copy. Saving back checks the server revision first; if another user has changed the file, SketchForge refuses to overwrite it and asks the user to reload or save with another name. This is shared file storage, not simultaneous live editing.

### Let Other Computers Join

Other computers on the same Wi-Fi or LAN need the server computer's local IP address.

On Windows PowerShell, run:

```powershell
ipconfig
```

Look for the `IPv4 Address`, for example:

```text
192.168.1.25
```

Then other computers can open:

```text
http://192.168.1.25:3000/
```

Use your own IP address, not the example one.

### Use a Different Port

If port `3000` is already being used, choose another port such as `8080`.

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:SKETCHFORGE_PORT = "8080"
docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose.yaml up --build -d
```

Linux or macOS:

```bash
SKETCHFORGE_PORT=8080 docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose.yaml up --build -d
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

### Stop SketchForge

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose.yaml down
```

### Update SketchForge Later

The home dashboard's **Settings** panel checks the official version and displays an update prompt when a newer version is available. It never installs an update automatically. Choosing **Not now** dismisses only that version, so a later release will be offered again.

If you used Git, update the existing checkout in place. You do not need to remove or download the repository again:

```bash
git pull
docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose.yaml up --build -d
```

If you use the prebuilt GHCR Compose file:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose-ghcr.yaml pull sketchforge
docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose-ghcr.yaml up -d --no-deps sketchforge
```

If you downloaded the ZIP, download the newest ZIP, extract it, and run:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose.yaml up --build -d
```

Application updates do not clear private projects stored in the browser. Docker shared projects remain in the existing `sketchforge-shared-projects` volume or the host directory configured with `SKETCHFORGE_SHARED_PROJECTS_VOLUME`. Never add `--volumes` or `-v` to an update command.

For an administrator-managed one-click installation, configure all of the following server variables:

- `SKETCHFORGE_UPDATE_TRIGGER_URL`: an internal HTTPS endpoint that pulls/recreates only the SketchForge application while retaining its existing project volume.
- `SKETCHFORGE_UPDATE_ADMIN_KEY`: the key the administrator must enter in the confirmation dialog.
- `SKETCHFORGE_UPDATE_TRIGGER_TOKEN` (optional): a bearer token SketchForge sends only to the internal update service.

Without an administrator-managed trigger, the confirmation opens these safe update instructions instead of granting the web container access to the Docker socket.

### Docker Troubleshooting

- **`docker` is not recognized**: install Docker Desktop, open it, and try again.
- **Docker says the daemon is not running**: Docker Desktop is closed or still starting.
- **Port already in use**: use another port, for example `8080`.
- **Other computers cannot connect**: check that they are on the same network and that the server firewall allows the chosen port.
- **The page opens but old files appear**: stop and rebuild with `docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose.yaml down`, then `docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose.yaml up --build -d`.

If you already have Node.js installed, the repository also includes shortcuts:

```bash
npm run docker:up
npm run docker:down
```

## Local Development

Use this path if you want to edit SketchForge's code.

### What You Need

- Node.js 24 or newer (Node 24 LTS recommended; required by `brepjs`)
- npm, included with Node.js

Check your versions:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If those commands do not work, install Node.js from the official Node.js website and reopen your terminal.

### Install and Run

From the SketchForge project folder:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you use nvm, first run `nvm install` and `nvm use` in the project folder. The included `.nvmrc` selects Node 24. Older Node versions report an `EBADENGINE` warning for `brepjs`.

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

Leave the terminal open while you use the app. To stop the development server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

The **Save to folder** setting is limited to existing folders under your user `Downloads` directory. To use a different root, set `SKETCHFORGE_LOCAL_DOWNLOAD_ROOT` before starting SketchForge. For example, on macOS or Linux:

```bash
SKETCHFORGE_LOCAL_DOWNLOAD_ROOT=/path/to/exports npm run dev
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:SKETCHFORGE_LOCAL_DOWNLOAD_ROOT = "C:\path\to\exports"
npm run dev
```

### Useful Developer Commands

Run TypeScript checks:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

Run tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

Run the mobile browser regression suite (separate from the unit tests):

```bash
npx playwright install chromium webkit
npm run test:mobile
```

The suite uses a server on port 3000 or starts one automatically. See [Mobile Alpha validation](docs/MOBILE_ALPHA.md#validation) for custom server URLs and coverage.

Start the local SketchForge MCP bridge for editor automation:

```bash
npm run mcp:sketchforge
```

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Build a static export on Windows Command Prompt:

```bash
npm run export
```

On macOS or Linux, use the equivalent environment-variable syntax:

```bash
npm run copy:occt
STATIC_EXPORT=true npx next build apps/web --webpack
npm run verify:static-worker-assets
```

Static hosting provides the browser editor; server-backed features such as the shared project library require a server deployment.

Run or package the Electron desktop app:

```bash
npm run desktop:dev
npm run desktop:dist
```

## License

Copyright © 2026 SketchForge contributors.

SketchForge is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 only** (`AGPL-3.0-only`). If you modify SketchForge and let users interact with the modified version over a network, you must offer those users the corresponding source code under the same license. See [LICENSE](LICENSE).

The application exposes a **Source** link in the dashboard. Operators distributing or hosting a modified build should set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOURCE_CODE_URL` at build time to the public URL containing that build's complete corresponding source code.

## SketchForge MCP Skill

SketchForge includes a local MCP server for AI clients that support MCP tools. It lets an agent inspect and control a live local editor tab: list open editors, read the scene, create/update/select objects, group/cut/separate parts, list CAD edge ids, apply chamfer or fillet, inspect errors, and capture viewport images.

This is for local development only. Run SketchForge with `npm run dev`; the MCP route is disabled in production builds and Docker/static hosting.

### Start SketchForge for MCP

From the SketchForge project folder:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open an editor tab:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000/?editor=1
```

The AI client starts the MCP server with:

```bash
node scripts/sketchforge-mcp-server.mjs
```

### Codex

The Codex skill is included at:

```text
docs/skills/sketchforge-mcp-skill
```

Install it into your Codex skills folder.

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills" | Out-Null
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force "docs\skills\sketchforge-mcp-skill" "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\sketchforge-mcp-skill"
```

macOS or Linux:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
cp -R docs/skills/sketchforge-mcp-skill ~/.codex/skills/
```

Then add an MCP server entry to your Codex config. Use [`docs/mcp/codex-config.example.toml`](docs/mcp/codex-config.example.toml) as the template and replace the script path with the absolute path on your machine. Restart Codex after changing the config.

Once installed, ask Codex:

```text
Use $sketchforge-mcp-skill to list my open SketchForge editors and inspect the current scene.
```

### Claude

Claude does not use Codex `SKILL.md` files, but it can use the same SketchForge MCP server. Add the server to Claude Desktop's MCP config using [`docs/mcp/claude-desktop-config.example.json`](docs/mcp/claude-desktop-config.example.json) as the template, replacing the script path with the absolute path on your machine.

After restarting Claude Desktop, ask:

```text
Use the SketchForge MCP tools to list open editors, inspect the scene, and modify the selected object.
```

The main tool names are `sketchforge_list_editors`, `sketchforge_read_scene`, `sketchforge_list_objects`, `sketchforge_create_shape`, `sketchforge_update_object`, `sketchforge_list_edges`, `sketchforge_apply_edge_treatment`, and `sketchforge_capture_image`.
